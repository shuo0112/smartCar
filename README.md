The smart car is a highly computerized automobile featuring ubiquitous computing, intuitive human-computer interaction and an open application platform. Here, we propose an advanced Smart Car demonstration platform with a transparent windshield display and various motion sensors where drivers can manipulate a variety of car-appropriate applications in augmented reality. Similar to smartphones, drivers can customize their Smart Car through free downloads of car-appropriate applications according to their wants and needs.

# Manage EVs. Balance the grid.
Smartcar allows energy and electric utility providers to remotely monitor their customers’ electric vehicles and manage residential EV charging.

Battery level：
Retrieve the state of charge (SoC) and the remaining range from an electric vehicle with a single API request.

Charging status：
Know when your customer’s EV is plugged in and if the battery is currently charging.

Start and stop charge (early access)：
Start and stop charging your customer’s vehicle remotely to balance their preferred schedule with the current electric grid load.
